# About Me

I am Pham Minh Man, a Machine Learning Engineer with experience in designing and implementing AI-driven solutions across various industries. My work focuses on building robust and scalable systems, from cutting-edge Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to enterprise-grade MLOps platforms. My experience includes leading engineering teams, architecting complex AI systems, and driving significant business outcomes through the application of machine learning and deep learning.

## Business Successes and Achievements

### Optimized AI Chatbot Deployment
At Kyanon Digital, I led a team that designed and built WisdomMind, a strategic internal GenAI platform. This project reduced chatbot deployment time by 60% by optimizing workflows and creating reusable modules.

### Enhanced E-commerce and Ride-hailing Efficiency
As a key member of the Be Smart Food Dispatch team at Be Group, I helped reduce waiting times for both users and drivers, which led to higher driver income and improved user satisfaction. I also contributed to the E-commerce (Be Food Recommendation) and Transport ETA systems.

### Developed a Legal-Tech Chatbot
I designed and developed MindLex, a legal-tech platform that processed over 134,000 legal records. This system specifically addressed the challenge of a multilingual corpus, including documents in Greek and Arabic, and featured a core function that linked AI-generated responses to their source documents for legal accuracy.

### Scaled an Educational AI Chatbot
I led the development of a custom AI chatbot system for an educational platform, which now serves over 30 teachers and handles more than 22,000 student interactions daily. The system used a dual-knowledge-base and a RAG strategy to mitigate AI hallucinations.

## Technical Expertise

### LLM & Generative AI

#### RAG Architecture
I specialize in building end-to-end RAG pipelines for enhanced information retrieval and generation. My skills include:
- Dense passage retrieval (DPR)
- ColBERT
- Dual-encoder architectures
